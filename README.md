Since the resources that a company has are limited, it is vital to find these customers and target them to win customer loyalty, drive business efficiencies and ultimately improve performance.

### Objective

1. To predict for all customers who shopped at-least once during 12/1/2009 till 11/9/2011.

2. To Predict who will come back to buy any product next month (11/9/2011 â€“ 12/9/2011).

3. To predict likelihood of customers shopping next month

### Variables
The variable names and their descriptions are as follows:

1. InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.

2. StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

3. Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.

### Method

1. Customer Clustering
2. RFM Timeseries

### Conclusion
1. We are able to separate customers into different segments, based on the type of products that they buy.

2. Using a Voting Classifier and a combination of multiple machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Logistic Regression, we are able to predict what type of product a user will buy, with a precision of 94.07%.

3. We can use this information to target selected customers with promotional offers for their desired products, which increases the likelihood of more sales in the future.
